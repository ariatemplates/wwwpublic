							<p>To ensure consistency throughout the source code, please <a href="/usermanual/Code_Standards">read and keep these rules in mind</a> as you are working.</p>

							<p>Even if you do not plan to push back some code, please let the community know as soon as you find a bug in aria templates.<p>
							<p>To file a bug, it's super easy. Just go to the <a href="https://github.com/ariatemplates/ariatemplates/issues">issue tracker</a> and create a new issue.<br />
							Keep in mind that an ideal bug report should contains a clear description of what is going wrong, and at least a few words about your expected behavior.<br />
							A supplementary test case would be perfect!</p>
